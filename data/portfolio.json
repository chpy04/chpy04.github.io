  "aboutpara": "I'm a second-year computer science and Mathematics student studying at Northeastern University, looking to graduate spring 2027. Currently, on top of my studies, I is working as a tech lead at Northeastern Electric Racing, where my team is implementing a design review process for engineers to upload, review, iterate, and approve CAD files for the car on our custom project management site. Additionally, I am a teaching assistant for the accel section of Fundamentals of Computer Science 2, the secretary for the Alpine Ski Team, and a brother at Delta Kappa Epsilon. My main technical interests include database design, backend web development, machine learning, and object-oriented design. Non-technically, you will find me on the slopes of ski mountains, hiking through the woods, or in an obscure coffee shop in boston"
