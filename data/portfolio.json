  "aboutpara": "I'm a third-year student studying computer science and mathematics at Northeastern University, with plans to graduate in spring 2027. On top of my studies, I am currently working as the head of web development at Northeastern Electric Racing, and am a regular volunteer at The Unicode Consortium writing code for their Adopt A Character program. Additionally, I am a teaching assistant for the accel section of Fundamentals of Computer Science 2, the treasurer for the Alpine Ski Team, and the scholarship chair at Delta Kappa Epsilon. My main technical interests include database design, backend web development, machine learning, and object-oriented design. Non-technically, you will find me on the slopes of ski mountains, hiking through the woods, or in an obscure coffee shop in Boston!"
